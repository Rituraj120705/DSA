Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x,
 find the index (0-based) of the largest element in arr[] that is less than or equal to x.
  This element is called the floor of x. If such an element does not exist, return -1.

Note: In case of multiple occurrences of floor of x, return the index of the last occurrence.

Examples

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: Largest number less than or equal to 5 is 2, whose index is 1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 11
Output: 4
Explanation: Largest Number less than or equal to 11 is 10, whose indices are 3 and 4. The index of last occurrence is 4.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 0
Output: -1
Explanation: No element less than or equal to 0 is found. So, output is -1.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
0 ≤ x ≤ arr[n-1]*/
