/*Q2. Word Squares II
Solved
Medium
4 pt.
You are given a string array words, consisting of distinct 4-letter strings, each containing lowercase English letters.

A word square consists of 4 distinct words: top, left, right and bottom, arranged as follows:

top forms the top row.
bottom forms the bottom row.
left forms the left column (top to bottom).
right forms the right column (top to bottom).
It must satisfy:

top[0] == left[0], top[3] == right[0]
bottom[0] == left[3], bottom[3] == right[3]
Return all valid distinct word squares, sorted in ascending lexicographic order by the 4-tuple (top, left, right, bottom)​​​​​​​.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["able","area","echo","also"]

Output: [["able","area","echo","also"],["area","able","also","echo"]]

Explanation:

There are exactly two valid 4-word squares that satisfy all corner constraints:

"able" (top), "area" (left), "echo" (right), "also" (bottom)
top[0] == left[0] == 'a'
top[3] == right[0] == 'e'
bottom[0] == left[3] == 'a'
bottom[3] == right[3] == 'o'
"area" (top), "able" (left), "also" (right), "echo" (bottom)
All corner constraints are satisfied.
Thus, the answer is [["able","area","echo","also"],["area","able","also","echo"]].

Example 2:

Input: words = ["code","cafe","eden","edge"]

Output: []

Explanation:

No combination of four words satisfies all four corner constraints. Thus, the answer is empty array [].

 

Constraints:

4 <= words.length <= 15
words[i].length == 4
words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
All words[i] are distinct.*/
